# Project: Chatbots Growth With Flow

## 1. What is this project?

This project is a custom-built AI chatbot designed to act as an intelligent, automated assistant.

It's not just a simple "FAQ bot." It is a collection of three distinct, specialized chatbots, each with a clear, valuable goal.

## 2. Where will it be used?

The chatbot is designed to be integrated directly into the "Growth With Flow" **Framer website**. It will be the primary point of interaction for visitors, clients, and recruiters.

## 3. What is the mission?

The mission is to use AI to automate and scale key business functions, saving time and creating a unique, high-value experience for every visitor.

### Use Cases:

1.  **For Visitors (General Info):**
    * It acts as an **expert assistant**, instantly answering questions about the company's services, culture, and projects with 100% on-brand accuracy.

2.  **For Potential Clients (Roadmap Flow):**
    * It acts as a **strategic consultant**. It asks smart questions about a client's goals, then automatically generates a customized strategic roadmap and a quote to help them succeed.

3.  **For Recruiters (Recruiter Flow):**
    * It acts as a **personal agent**. It asks the recruiter what job they are hiring for, then *dynamically generates a new, perfectly tailored resume* from a master database of skills and experiences.
